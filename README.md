# MUSEC
Quantification of mutant-allele expression at isoform level for multiple genes

What is MAX?
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
MAX is a novel method to quantify the Mutant-Allele eXpression (MAX) at isoform level from RNA-seq data. Devaloped by Wenjiang Deng. This method was futher optimised to qualtify the Mutant allele expression of multiple genes for multiple samples.
